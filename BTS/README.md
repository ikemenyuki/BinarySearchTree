# BINARY SEARCH TREE

There are four classes need to be implemented, among which three are the binary tree class, tree node class, and the queue class. 
First there are two BST contructors, one takes in two arrays as parameters, and the second one takes a file containing data and the lines to be read in as the parameters. To initialize the arrays as the binary tree, take the element in the middle index as the root node, and constantly split them into two halfs, using recursion to set the left childs and the right childs. The second constructor is implemented with the FileInputStream and the BufferedReader to read in the data and split them into two sorted arrays. Then use the same method in the first constructor to initialize the tree. 
Methods like adding nodes to the tree, getting the smallest and largest cities, get the width and the depth of the tree... Four different traversal methods and getting lists using the traversal. 
Different views fo the tree are obtained. 
Special tree implementations like flattening the tree to linked list, finding the paths etc... 
Test class are included.
